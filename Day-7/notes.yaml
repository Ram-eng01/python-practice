   LOOPS
-------------------------

Loops in Python allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly, either for a specified number of times or while a certain condition is true. Python provides two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.

1: for Loop:

 A for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each element in the sequence.
Syntax:
for variable in sequence: 
# Code to execute in each iteration


2: while Loop:

A while loop repeats as long as a specified condition is True. It is useful when the number of iterations is not predetermined.
Syntax:
while condition:
# Code to execute while the condition is true




----

break and continue Statements

	The break statement: is used to exit the loop prematurely, even if the condition for the loop has not become False.
	The continue statement: skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
