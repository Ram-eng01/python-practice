Condition Handlings
---------------------------

Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain code based on the evaluation of a condition. These statements include if, else, and elif (else if). They enable decision-making in your program, where different actions can be taken based on the given conditions.

 LIST
 --------------------

 List in Python:
 
List & Tuples
 
A list in Python is a mutable, ordered sequence of elements. Lists can contain elements of different types, and their elements can be modified after creation.
Characteristics of a List:
•	Mutable: Elements can be changed, added, or removed.
•	Ordered: Items have a defined order, and this order will not change unless explicitly modified.
•	Allows duplicates: Lists can have multiple items with the same value.


List Methods:
-	append(): Add an item to the end of the list.
-	insert(): Insert an item at a specified index.
-	remove(): Remove the first item with the specified value.
-	pop(): Remove an item at a specified index (or the last item if no index is provided).
-	sort(): Sort the list in place.


--------------------
 Tuples
-----------------------

A tuple in Python is an immutable, ordered sequence of elements. Like lists, tuples can contain elements of different types, but their elements cannot be modified once the tuple is created.
Characteristics of a Tuple:
•	Immutable: Elements cannot be changed after the tuple is created.
•	Ordered: Items have a defined order.
•	Allows duplicates: Tuples can contain multiple items with the same value. 


Methods in Tuples:
Since tuples are immutable, they have fewer methods than lists. However, two useful methods are:
•	count(): Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple.
•	index(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.
